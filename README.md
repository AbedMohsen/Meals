# Meals

## Description

This is a React-based mockup of a food ordering website. Users can seamlessly explore various food options and conveniently add them to their virtual shopping cart. The interface allows users to easily adjust the quantity of each selected food item, enabling them to increase or decrease the quantities or remove items from their cart altogether.
